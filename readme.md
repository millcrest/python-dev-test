# Python Bug Hunting Challenge

This repository contains three Python scripts, each of which contains one or more bugs that you need to identify and fix. 

The aim of this challenge is to test your ability to debug, understand, and write Python code, with an emphasis on threading, concurrency, and list manipulation.

## Test 1: List Rotation

The `1_rotate_list.py` script is supposed to rotate a list by `n` places to the left, where `n` is a positive integer. However, there are two bugs in the script that prevent it from working correctly. 

Your task is to find and fix these bugs, ensuring that the script correctly rotates the list for any valid input.

## Test 2: Removing Duplicates and Summation

The `2_remove_duplicates_and_sum.py` script is supposed to remove duplicate elements from a list and return the sum of the unique elements. However, there are three bugs in the script that prevent it from working correctly. 

Your task is to find and fix these bugs, ensuring that the script correctly removes duplicates and calculates the sum for any valid input.

## Test 3: Multithreading and Concurrency

The `3_multithreading.py` script is a multithreaded application that performs two types of tasks on two different lists using multiple worker threads, while a monitor thread keeps track of the progress. However, there are six bugs in the script that prevent it from working correctly. 

Your task is to find and fix these bugs, ensuring that the script correctly performs all tasks and the monitor accurately tracks the progress under all conditions.

## Test 4: Hangman Game

The `4_hangman.py` script is an implementation of the classic Hangman game. However, there are several bugs in the script that affect its functionality.

Your task is to find and fix these bugs to ensure that the Hangman game works correctly, following the game's rules and providing a fair gameplay experience.

Remember to consider different edge cases and invalid input scenarios when testing your fixes.

To get started, clone this repository and run each script to see what it does. Then start hunting for the bugs!

Remember, the goal is not just to make the scripts work, but to make them work correctly. Be sure to test your fixes with different inputs and scenarios to ensure that they truly solve the problem.

Good luck!
